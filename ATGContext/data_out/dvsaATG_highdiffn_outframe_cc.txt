# dvsaATG_highdiffn_outframe_cc.txt
# Genes with conserved out-of-frame high-score dATGs
# In both H99 and JEC21:
#   - in top 5% by difference, aATG.scorekn - d1.scorekn
#   - in top 50% by RNA abundance
#   - dATG is out of frame with aATG
#
# H99: H99 systematic gene name
# JEC21: JEC21 systematic gene name of ortholog
# a.skn.xx: annotated ATG score against narrow Kozak consensus sequence, strain xx
# d.skn.xx: 1st downstream ATG score against narrow Kozak consensus sequence, strain xx

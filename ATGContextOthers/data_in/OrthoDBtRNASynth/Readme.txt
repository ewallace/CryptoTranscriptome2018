Lists of orthologs for selected genes, within *fungi*, from orthodb.org

E.G. https://www.orthodb.org/?query=YBR121c

ArgRS, only one copy in Crypto. Two copies in cerevisiae post-WGD.
AspRS, two copies in most fungi, Scer has known Mito and cyto copies
Note SerRS has 2 copies in almost every genome.

For Asp, Lys, Ser, 2 copies in almost every fungal genome, orthodb has cyto and mito copies in the same ortholog group.
Within Saccharomycetales, they are in separate ortholog groups.
Duplicated as dikarya? Yes. Oh dear that means I should do again for dikarya.

GluRS Gus1: single-copy in cerevisiae but 2-3 in several others.
LysRS, 2 separately localized enzymes in ascomycota, 1 dual-localized in basidiomycota, in same ortholog group
ProRS, 2 separately localized enzymes in most places except Cryptococci which have one dual-localized. mtProRS in different ortholog group
ThrRS, 2 separately localized enzymes in most places except Cryptococci which have one?? mtThrRS in same ortholog group
TrpRS, 2 separately localized enzymes in most places except Cryptococci which have one dual-localized. mtTrpRS in different ortholog group
TyrRS, Cryptococci have extra domain in cytoTyrRS which confuses hoomology prediction.

HisRS is different: mitofates fails to predict mitochondrial localization of many orthologs, but Chiu et al 1992 point out that there's an unusual downstream component to mitochondrial localizaion.
